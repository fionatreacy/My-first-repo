Fire and Gas Detection Services website offers a brief introduction to the services offered by Fire and Gas ltd. and refers potential queries to the contact page.

# Features
## Navigation
Shown on the left of the page are links to the HOME, OUR SERVICES and CONTACT US pages. 

The logo at the top of each page also serves as a navigation link to the HOME page.

The colour of the font is charcoal grey to both compliment the logo colours, and contrast with the background.

## Home Page
The home page provides an introduction to the company and the services it provides, and encourages the reader to explore the website further by referring them to other pages.

This page provides basic information to allow the reader to know what the FIre and Gas is and what services it provides at a glance.

All information is layed out on a semi-transparent background over the background image, to ensure it is easy to read and won't get lost on the background image.

## Our Services Page
This page provides slightly more in depth information about what services are provided, while also being concise and to the point.

There are three sections, Auditing, Design and Training, which contain short bullet-pointed lists. 

As with the home page, all information is laid out on a semi-transparent background so the background doesn't distract from the text.

## Contact Us
The Contact Us page contains a form with several inputs, Name, Phone Number, E-mail, and Your Enquiry.

Each input is required, to ensure their query and information is received and they can be responded to.

## Testing
I tested this website on chrome, firefox and safari to ensure that it works.

I checked that the responsive aspects worked.

I adjusted the css so that the layout worked across multiple screen sizes such as tablets and laptops.

I tested the form to make sure all aspects of it work, all inputs are required, and only email addresses can be accepted in the email field.


## Validator testing
I put my code through the W3C validator and discovered I had left a h2 element empty, and put in duplicate anchor elements on the same line.
I removed these errors.

I also put my CSS code through jigsaw CSS validator and discovered I had entered 2 invalid font weights, I adjusted them to the correct weights.

I ran my website through lighthouse in devtools to ensure all my colours and fonts were readable and accessible.
